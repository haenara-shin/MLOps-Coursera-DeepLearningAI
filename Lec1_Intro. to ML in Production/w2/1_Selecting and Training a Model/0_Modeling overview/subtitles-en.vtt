00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi, welcome back. In this week,

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.120
you learn about some best
practices for building

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.950
a machine learning model that is

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.470
worthy of a production
deployment.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.380
One of my friends,
Adam Cotes joke that

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.820
the way he listened to me

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.590
give advice to machine
learning teams,

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.555
he felt the way I get advice was

9
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.000
quite consistent from
project to project,

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.310
so that he could
almost replace me with

11
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.190
an if then else
sequence of statements.

12
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.350
I found too when several senior

13
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.600
machinery engineers
look at the project,

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.920
the advice they tend to give

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.345
is also remarkably consistent.

16
00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:36.900
What you learned in this
week is whether some of

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.120
the key challenges
of trying to build

18
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.820
a production-ready
machine learning model,

19
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.370
things like how do you
handle new datasets?

20
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.650
Or what if you do
well in the test set,

21
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.775
but for some reason,

22
00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:51.420
that still isn't good enough
for your actual application?

23
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.750
I hope that after this
week's materials,

24
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.330
you'll be able to
very efficiently

25
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
know how to improve your
machine learning model,

26
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.025
to solve the most
important problems

27
00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:04.065
that then make it
deployment's ready.

28
00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:05.700
Let's dive in. This week,

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.215
our focus will be on

30
00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:09.540
the modeling part of

31
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.615
the full cycle of a
machine learning project,

32
00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.209
and you learn some suggestions

33
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:17.100
for how to select
and train the model,

34
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.485
and how to perform
error analysis,

35
00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.160
and use that to drive
model improvements.

36
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.620
One of the themes you hear me
refer to multiple times is

37
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.794
model-centric AI development

38
00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:31.245
versus data-centric
AI development.

39
00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:33.445
The way that AI has grown up,

40
00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:35.160
there's been a lot of emphasis on

41
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.200
how to choose the right model,

42
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.460
such as maybe how to choose

43
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.505
the right neural
network architecture.

44
00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:43.470
I found that for
practical projects,

45
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.060
it can be even more

46
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.239
useful to take a more
data-centric approach,

47
00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.830
where you focus not just on

48
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.725
improving the neural
network architecture,

49
00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:55.230
but on making sure
you are feeding

50
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.455
your algorithm high-quality data.

51
00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:00.630
That ultimately lets you be more

52
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.345
efficient in getting your
system to perform well.

53
00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:05.070
But the way I engage in

54
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.200
data-centric AI
development is not

55
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.840
to just go and try to
collect more data,

56
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.595
which can be very time-consuming,

57
00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:14.640
but to instead use
tools to help me

58
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.030
improve the data in the most
efficient possible way.

59
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.415
You'll learn some ways for
how to do that in this week.

60
00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.490
I'm excited to go through

61
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.565
this week's materials with
you on training models.

62
00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:29.550
But first, let's look at
some key challenges that

63
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.745
many fields face when building
machine learning models.

64
00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:34.920
By understanding
these key challenges,

65
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.620
you'd be better able to
spot them ahead of time,

66
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.545
and adjust them more
efficiently for your projects.

67
00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:42.910
Let's go on to the next video.
