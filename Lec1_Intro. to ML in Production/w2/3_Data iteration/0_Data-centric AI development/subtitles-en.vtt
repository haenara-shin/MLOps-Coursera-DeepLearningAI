00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's say that era analysis has

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.920
caused you to decide to focus on

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.240
improving your outcome learning

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.050
performance on data with
a certain audio tag,

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.275
say speech with car
noise in the background.

6
00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.360
Let's take a look
at how you can take

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.925
a data centric approach

8
00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.820
to improving your learning
outcomes performance.

9
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.560
You've heard me speak before

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.390
about model centric versus
data centric AI developments.

11
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.155
Here's a little more
detail on what I mean.

12
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.380
With a model centric
view of AI developments,

13
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.570
you would take the
data you have and

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.670
then try to work really hard to

15
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.630
develop a model that does as
well as possible on the data

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.790
because a lot of
academic research on

17
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.190
AI was driven by researchers,

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.575
downloading a benchmark data set

19
00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:52.225
and trying to do well
on that benchmark.

20
00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:56.580
Most academic research
on AI is model centric,

21
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.060
because the benchmark data
set is a fixed quantity.

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.969
In this view, model
centric development,

23
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.390
you would hold the data fixed
and iterative the improve.

24
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.075
In this model centric view,

25
00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:11.490
you would hold the data fixed and

26
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.785
iteratively improve
the code or the model.

27
00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:17.490
There's still an
important role to play

28
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.010
in trying to come up
with better models,

29
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.040
but that's a different
view of AI developments

30
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.925
which I think is more useful
for many applications.

31
00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:29.010
Which is to shift a data from

32
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.875
a model centric to what
a data centric view.

33
00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.020
In this view, we think of

34
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.630
the quality of the
data as paramount,

35
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.010
and you can use tools
such as era analysis or

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.680
data augmentation
to systematically

37
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.440
improve the data quality.

38
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.330
For many applications, I

39
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.340
find that if your
data is good enough,

40
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.300
there are multiple models
that will do just fine.

41
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.415
In this view, you can
instead hold the code

42
00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.940
fixed and iteratively
improve the data.

43
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.745
There's a role for model
centric development,

44
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.565
and there's a role for
data centric development.

45
00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:08.940
If you've been used
to model centric

46
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.530
thinking for most of

47
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.115
your experience with
machine learning,

48
00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:13.320
I would urge you to

49
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.515
consider taking a data
centric view as well,

50
00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:17.940
where when you're trying to

51
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.145
improve your learning
outcomes performance,

52
00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:25.200
try asking how can you make
your data set even better?

53
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.650
One of the most important
ways to improve

54
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.610
the quality of a data set
is data augmentation.

55
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.310
Let's go on to the next
video where we'll start

56
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.770
to take a look at
data augmentation.
