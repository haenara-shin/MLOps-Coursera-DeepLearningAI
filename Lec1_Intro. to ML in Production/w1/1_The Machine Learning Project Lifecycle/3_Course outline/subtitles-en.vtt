00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
You've seen the machine
learning project life cycle.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.550
Let's briefly go over what

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.935
you'll learn in the
rest of this course.

4
00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:09.720
Even though I presented

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.585
the life cycle going
from left to right,

6
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.480
I found that for learning
these materials,

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.340
it will be more efficient for

8
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.215
you to start at the end goal,

9
00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.790
and start from deployment,

10
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.740
and then work backwards to

11
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.050
modeling data and then scoping.

12
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.715
In the rest of this week,

13
00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.095
starting with the next video,

14
00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.585
you'll learn about the
most important ideas

15
00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:32.190
in Deployment.

16
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.125
Next week, in Week 2,

17
00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.285
you'll learn about modeling.

18
00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:38.430
You may have learned
about how to train

19
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970
a machine learning model
from other courses.

20
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.875
In this video, I'll share

21
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.280
some new ideas that you may
not have heard before of

22
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.595
how to systematically use
a data-centric approach

23
00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.380
to be more efficient in how you

24
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.500
improve the performance
of your model.

25
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.230
Then in the third,

26
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.195
and final week of this course,

27
00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:59.135
you'll learn about data.

28
00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:02.375
How to define data and
establish a baseline,

29
00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.190
and how to label and organize

30
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.245
your data in a way
that is systematic.

31
00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:09.540
Not Ad hoc, not hacking around in

32
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.940
the Jupyter notebook in the hope

33
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.500
that you stumble onto
the right insights,

34
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.135
but in a more systematic way

35
00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.160
that helps you be
more efficient in

36
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.230
defining the data that will help

37
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.920
the modeling to help
you get to deployment.

38
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.300
Then finally, in Week 3 we'll

39
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.225
also have an optional
section on scoping.

40
00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.795
In which I hope to share with
you some tips I've learned

41
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:33.695
on how to define effective
machine learning projects.

42
00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:36.875
Throughout this course, you'll
also learn about MLOps,

43
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.110
or machine learning operations.

44
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.865
Which is an emerging discipline

45
00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:43.070
that comprises a set of tools and

46
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.170
principles to support progress

47
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.615
through the machine ML
project life cycle,

48
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:50.705
but especially these three steps.

49
00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:53.885
For example, at Landing
AI, where I'm CEO,

50
00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:55.970
we used to do a lot of
these steps manually,

51
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.725
which is okay, but slow.

52
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:00.290
But after building
an MLOps tool called

53
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.855
LandingLens for computer
vision applications,

54
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.895
all these steps
became much quicker.

55
00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.190
The key idea in MLOps is

56
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.235
that systematic ways to
think about scoping, data,

57
00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.560
modeling, and
deployment, and also

58
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.210
software tools to support
the best practices.

59
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.260
That's it. In this course,

60
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.000
we're going to start
at the end goal,

61
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.855
start from deployment, and
then work our way backwards.

62
00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:25.455
As you already know,

63
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:28.940
being able to deploy system
is one of the most important,

64
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.460
and valuable skills in
Machine Learning today.

65
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.195
Let's go on to the next video
where we'll dive deep into

66
00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:37.880
the most important ideas

67
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.655
needed to deploy machine
learning systems.

68
00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:43.260
I will see you in the next video.
