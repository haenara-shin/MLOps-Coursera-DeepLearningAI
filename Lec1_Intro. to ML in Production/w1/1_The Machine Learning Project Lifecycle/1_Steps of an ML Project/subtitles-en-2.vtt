00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
When I'm building a machine

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.645
learning system, I've found that,

3
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.090
thinking through the
Machine Learning project

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.770
lifecycle is

5
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.915
a effective way
for me to plan out

6
00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:12.825
all the steps that
I need to work on.

7
00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.435
When you are working on
Machine Learning system,

8
00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.970
I think you'll find too
that this framework allows

9
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.460
you to plan out all the
important things you

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.950
need to do in order
to get the system to

11
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.965
work and also to
minimize surprises.

12
00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.140
Let's dive in. These are

13
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.795
the major steps of a
Machine Learning project.

14
00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.420
First is scoping,
in which you have

15
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.310
to define the project or
decide what to work on.

16
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.050
What exactly do you want to
apply Machine Learning to,

17
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.930
and what is X and what is Y.

18
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.980
After having chosen the project,

19
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.220
you then have to collect data or

20
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.885
acquire the data you
need for your algorithm.

21
00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.490
This includes defining the data

22
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.214
and establishing a baseline,

23
00:00:57.214 --> 00:01:00.605
and then also labeling
and organizing the data.

24
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.240
There are some best practices for

25
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.710
this that are non-intuitive

26
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.205
that you learn more about
later in this week.

27
00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.945
After you have your data,

28
00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:11.540
you then have to train the model.

29
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.875
During the model phase,

30
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.420
you have to select and train

31
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.420
the model and also
perform error analysis.

32
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.540
You might know that
Machine Learning

33
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.135
is often a highly iterative task.

34
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.235
During the process
of error analysis,

35
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:27.650
you may go back and
update the model,

36
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.185
or you may also go back
to the earlier phase

37
00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.205
and decide you need to
collect more data as well.

38
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:35.495
As part of error analysis

39
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.624
before taking a system
to deployments,

40
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:41.330
I'll often also carry
out a final check,

41
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.830
maybe a final audit,

42
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.830
to make sure that the system's
performance is good enough

43
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.675
and that it's sufficiently
reliable for the application.

44
00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.890
Sometimes, an engineer
thinks that when you

45
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.220
deploy a system, you're done.

46
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.985
I now tell most people,

47
00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.145
when you deploy a system
for the first time,

48
00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:00.830
you are maybe about halfway
to the finish line,

49
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.140
because it's often only after you

50
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.840
turn on live traffic
that you then

51
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.300
learn the second half of
the important lessons

52
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.720
needed in order to get the
system to perform well.

53
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.685
To carry out the deployment step,

54
00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:15.880
you have to deploy
it in production,

55
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.655
write the software needed to
put into production,

56
00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.975
Then also monitor the system,

57
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.255
track the data that
continues to come in,

58
00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.775
and maintain the system.

59
00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.805
For example, if the data
distribution changes,

60
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.090
you may need to update the model.

61
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.805
After the initial deployment,

62
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:38.120
maintenance will often
mean going back to

63
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.420
perform more error analysis
and maybe retrain the model,

64
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.200
or it might mean taking
the data you get back.

65
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.580
Now that the system is deployed

66
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.290
and is running on live data,

67
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.090
and feeding that back into

68
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.935
your dataset to then
potentially update your data,

69
00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:57.980
retrain the model, and
so on until you can put

70
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.375
an updated model into deployment.

71
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:03.980
I found this framework useful for

72
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.055
a very large variety of
Machine Learning projects.

73
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:09.755
From computer vision,
to audio data,

74
00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:13.515
to structure data, to
many other applications.

75
00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:15.260
Feel free to take a screenshot of

76
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.150
this image and use it with

77
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.160
your friends or by yourself to

78
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.910
plan out your Machine
Learning project as well.

79
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.755
Thanks also to learning AIs,

80
00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.930
Steven Layett and
Daniel Pipryata,

81
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.690
who were instrumental to
developing this diagram.

82
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.685
In this video, we
quickly went through

83
00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.120
the machine learning
project lifecycle in order

84
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.770
to deepen our understanding of

85
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.750
this project lifecycle or be

86
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.900
useful to walk through
a concrete example.

87
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.505
In the next video,

88
00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:46.070
let's step through what
these different steps of

89
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.890
machine learning project
lifecycle look like in

90
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.190
the context of a speech
recognition application.

91
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.720
Let's go on to the next video.
