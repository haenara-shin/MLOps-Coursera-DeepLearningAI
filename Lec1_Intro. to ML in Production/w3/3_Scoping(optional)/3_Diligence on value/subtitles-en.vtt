00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.529
How do you estimate

2
00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:04.260
the value of Machine
Learning Project?

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.050
This is sometimes not
easy to estimate,

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.705
but let me share with you
a few best practices.

5
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.880
Took speech recognition, let's

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.040
say you're working on building

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.410
a more accurate speech
recognition system

8
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.760
for the purpose of

9
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.830
voice search so that
people speak to

10
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.655
the smartphone app
to do web searches.

11
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.790
It turns out that
in most businesses

12
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.620
there will be some metrics

13
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.020
that machine learning engineers

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.845
are used to optimizing
and some metrics that

15
00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:37.380
the owners of the product or

16
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.685
the business will
want to maximize.

17
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.810
There's often a gap between

18
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.250
these two building machine
learning systems to objective

19
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.160
that a learning
algorithm may optimize

20
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.165
might be something right
where level accuracy.

21
00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:58.020
If a user says a certain
number of words,

22
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.930
how many of the words
do we get right?

23
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.970
Maybe the learning algorithm

24
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.650
actually does great in the sense

25
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.735
on log-likelihood or
some other criteria.

26
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:10.425
But many machine learning
teams would be comfortable

27
00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:13.800
trying to get good
words-level accuracy.

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.305
But when using this in
a business context,

29
00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:20.414
one other key metrics
query-level accuracy,

30
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.500
which is how often do you get

31
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.900
all the words in a query right.

32
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.520
For some businesses word-level
accuracy is important,

33
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.615
but query-level accuracy
may be even more important.

34
00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:37.755
We've now taken one step
away from the objective

35
00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:39.450
that the learning algorithm

36
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.675
is almost directly optimizing.

37
00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:45.405
Even after you get
the query right,

38
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.510
which is important for
the user experience,

39
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.670
what users care even more

40
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.580
about is the search
result quality.

41
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.490
The reason the business may want

42
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.280
to ensure search result quality

43
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.200
is that this gives users

44
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.130
a better experience and just
increases user engagement,

45
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.740
so they come back to the
search engine more often.

46
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.640
This is important, but
this is just one step

47
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.960
towards actually driving the
revenue of the business.

48
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.120
One gap I've often seen

49
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.730
between machine learning
teams and business teams

50
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.890
is the entry team will
usually want to work on this,

51
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.150
whereas the business leader
may once promises on that.

52
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.990
In order for a project
to move forward,

53
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.720
I usually try to have
the technical and

54
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.850
the business teams try to agree

55
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.280
on metrics that both
are comfortable with.

56
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.740
This often takes a little bit of

57
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.370
compromise where the machine
learning team might stretch

58
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.800
a little bit further
to the right and

59
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.360
the business teams stretch

60
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.625
a little bit further to the left.

61
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.560
The further we go to the right,

62
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.000
the harder it is for

63
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.560
a machine learning team to
really give a guarantee.

64
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.650
I wish more problems
could be solved by

65
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.615
gradient descent or by
optimizing tested accuracy.

66
00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:16.360
But that's just not to
say of the world today,

67
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.780
a lot of practical
problems require

68
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.310
we do something more than

69
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.780
just optimizing tested accuracy.

70
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.350
Having the technical team and

71
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.540
the business teams both step

72
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.060
a little bit outside their
comfort zone is often

73
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.030
important for reaching
compromise to pick

74
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.020
some set of metrics that the
technical team feels like

75
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.550
could stretch a bit to deliver

76
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.310
on and that the business
team can stretch

77
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.445
a bit to feel comfortable will

78
00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:46.945
create sufficient value
for the business.

79
00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:50.455
One other practice
I've found useful

80
00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:54.730
is that if you can do
even very rough back of

81
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.670
the envelope calculations to

82
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.470
relate what level of

83
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.810
accuracy to some of the
metrics on the right.

84
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.320
If word accuracy
improves by one percent,

85
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.260
if you have any rough guess

86
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.424
for will that improve
query level accuracy,

87
00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:16.010
maybe by 0.7 percent
or 0.8 percent,

88
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.600
and how much will that improve

89
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.920
search result quality and

90
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.570
user engagement
and maybe revenue,

91
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.270
if able to come up with

92
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.990
even a very crude back of
the envelope calculation.

93
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.440
Sometimes these are also
called Fermi estimates.

94
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.410
You can read about
this on Wikipedia.

95
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.850
That can also be a
way to help bridge

96
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.110
the machine learning and gene

97
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.375
metrics and business metrics.

98
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.660
Now it goes without
saying that as

99
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.200
part of estimating the
value of a project,

100
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.715
I would encourage you to give

101
00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:57.290
thought to any ethical
considerations as well,

102
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.570
such as is this project

103
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.360
creating net positive
societal value?

104
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.590
If not, I hope you won't do it.

105
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.120
Or is this project
reasonably fair and

106
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.520
free from bias and have any

107
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.980
ethical or values-based concerns

108
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.680
been openly aired and debated?

109
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.810
I find it issues of

110
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.840
values and ethics is
very domain-dependent,

111
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.110
is very different in
making loans versus

112
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.335
health care versus
recommending products online.

113
00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:31.670
Encourage you to look up

114
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.580
any ethical frameworks that have

115
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.090
been developed for your
industry and your application.

116
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.310
If you have any concerns,

117
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.720
raise it for debate
within your team.

118
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.270
Ultimately, if you don't

119
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.100
think the project
you're working on

120
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.840
will help other people or

121
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.025
will help humanity move forward,

122
00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:53.270
I hope you'll keep
searching for other,

123
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.825
more meaningful
projects to jump into.

124
00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.660
In my work, I have faced
difficult choices where

125
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.520
I really wasn't sure if

126
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.245
a particular project was
something I should work on.

127
00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.850
Because I really didn't
know if it would make

128
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.190
people net-net better off,

129
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.720
and I found that having

130
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.740
a team debate and
discuss it openly often

131
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.455
helps us get to better answer

132
00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:20.580
and feel more comfortable with
whatever decision we make.

133
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.750
I have called
multiple projects on

134
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.420
ethical considerations
when I felt

135
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.540
the project was
economically sound,

136
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.250
but I didn't think it
would help people,

137
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.540
and I just told the team,

138
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.235
I don't want to do it
and I won't do it.

139
00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:35.080
I hope this gives
you a framework for

140
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.650
evaluating the
value of a project.

141
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.335
On the ethics and value piece,

142
00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:44.080
I think all of us collectively
should only work on

143
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.020
projects that create net
positive social value,

144
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.005
that help other people that
move humanity forward.

145
00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:53.045
I personally cool projects
just on that basis.

146
00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:55.630
There are multiple
projects that I

147
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.810
felt the economic value
was completely sound.

148
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.850
The economic case
is completely fine,

149
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.695
but I look for the
price and I said,

150
00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:05.955
I don't think this actually
helps people and have

151
00:07:05.955 --> 00:07:09.475
cool projects just on that
basis and told my teams,

152
00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:10.870
let's find something else to work

153
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.430
on because I'm not
going to do that.

154
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.810
I hope that you also be able
to focus your efforts just

155
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.880
on projects that help people

156
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.250
and that help move
humanity forward.
