00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.098
Picking the right project to work
on is one of the most rare and

2
00:00:04.098 --> 00:00:05.990
valuable schools in Ai today.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.356
In the next few videos, I'd like to share
with you some best practices for scoping,

4
00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:16.440
picking what project to work on and also
planning out the scope of the project.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.281
I remember when I was younger, I tended
to just jump into the first project

6
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:26.440
that I got excited about and sometimes
I was lucky and it worked out okay.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.627
Now that I've had a little
bit more experience,

8
00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:34.366
I find that if you buy yourself or
your team is going to spend a lot of time,

9
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:39.264
weeks or months or even longer work on
the project is well worth your while to

10
00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:44.086
think through a few options and try to
select the most promising project to

11
00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.440
work on before putting so
much effort into it.

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.495
So that let's dive into scoping.

13
00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:57.940
Let's use the example of an e commerce
retailer looking to increase sales.

14
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.783
If you were to sit down and brainstorm
what and Nikon company could do,

15
00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:08.366
you might come up with many ideas, such
as maybe a better product recommendation

16
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:13.046
system or better search so
people can find what they're looking for

17
00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:16.903
or you may find that the catalog
data is missing fields or

18
00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:21.861
is incomplete and this affects
search your recommendations results.

19
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.870
So you might see the project to improve
the quality of the catalog data.

20
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.903
Or you may help them with inventory
management, such as deciding how many

21
00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:36.340
shirts to buy, where to ship the shirts or
what price optimization.

22
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.268
With a quick brainstorming session,
you may be able to come up with dozens of

23
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.351
ideas for
how to help this e commerce retailer.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.720
The questions that we like to answer,
the scoping process are what project or

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.532
projects should we work on.

26
00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:57.342
Whether the metrics for success and
whether the resources such as data time,

27
00:01:57.342 --> 00:02:00.340
people needed to execute this project.

28
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.151
What I've seen in a lot of businesses is
that of all the ideas you can work on.

29
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:07.531
Some are going to be much
more valuable than others.

30
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:12.390
Maybe two times or five times or 10 times
more valuable than a different idea.

31
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.268
And being able to pick the most valuable
project will significantly increase

32
00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.840
the impact of your work.

33
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.205
Machine learning is a general purpose to
there are a lot of things we could do with

34
00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:24.080
machine learning.

35
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.400
How do we take valuable
projects to work on?

36
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.151
Let's dive more deeply into
the scoping process in the next video.
