00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.155
Say you've identified
the problem,

2
00:00:02.155 --> 00:00:03.810
found a worthy solution,

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.120
finish diligence for
technical feasibility

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.030
and value and you think
this is worth doing.

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.010
Let's take a look at
the last steps of

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.625
the scoping process of
milestones and resourcing.

7
00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.760
Determining milestones
and resourcing involves

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.940
writing out the key
specifications for your project.

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.520
This will include
machine learning metrics

10
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.175
such as accuracy or
precision-recall.

11
00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.410
For some applications,
this may also

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.680
include fairness
types of metrics.

13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.930
The specification will
often also include

14
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.940
software metrics regarding

15
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.790
the software system
such as latency,

16
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.470
throughput, queries per second,

17
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.610
and so on given

18
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.200
the computational resources
available, and if possible,

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.140
you might also write
out estimates of

20
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.880
the business metrics you hope to

21
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.980
move for the project
you're scoping,

22
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.275
such as how much
incremental revenue

23
00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:57.180
if you have a way
of estimating that?

24
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.680
In addition, writing out

25
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.140
the resources needed,
how much data?

26
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.450
From which teams? Personnel, any

27
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.280
help you need from
cross-functional teams.

28
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.560
What software integrations, data

29
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.030
leaving support or other support

30
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.815
you need from other teams.

31
00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.790
Finally, the timeline on

32
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.090
which you hope to achieve

33
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.220
certain milestones
or deliverables.

34
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.690
Now, if you're looking at

35
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.950
a machine learning project

36
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.180
and you find that you're having

37
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.785
a very hard time

38
00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:27.190
writing on some of these
key specifications,

39
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.300
then you might also
consider carrying out

40
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.700
a bench-marking exercise
to compare it to

41
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.860
other similar projects that

42
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.690
others may have worked on before,

43
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.470
or building a proof
of concept first in

44
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.010
order to get a better sense
of what accuracy, precision,

45
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.965
or latency throughput or other
metrics might be feasible,

46
00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:52.765
and only after you've done
that POC, proof of concept,

47
00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:55.390
to then use that
information to more

48
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.570
confidently scope out
the milestones and

49
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.160
resources needed for a
larger scale execution

50
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.285
of the project you have in mind.

51
00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:07.870
That's it. Congratulations
on making it

52
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.290
to the end of this
section on scoping.

53
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.090
I hope that these
ideas will help you to

54
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.240
pick valuable and meaningful
projects to work on.

55
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.475
Thank you also for sticking
with me from deployment,

56
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.245
through modeling,
through training,

57
00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:25.344
all the way back to scoping,

58
00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.770
and I hope this framework of

59
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.500
the full cycle of machine
learning project will

60
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.105
also be useful for

61
00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:34.760
all the projects I hope
you will build and deploy.
