1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.706
I'd like to share with you a process for
scoping projects,

2
00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:07.060
that hope will be valuable for
how you decide what to work on.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.696
When I'm speaking with a company for
the first time about their AI projects,

4
00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:14.000
this is the process that I use as well.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.850
Let's dive in,
when brainstorming prices work on.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.480
The first thing I do is usually get
together with a business or private owner.

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.620
Often not an Ai person, but
someone that understands the business and

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.040
application and to brainstorm with them.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.240
What are their business or
application problems?

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.440
And at this stage I'm trying to identify
a business problem, not an Ai problem.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.252
So if I'm speaking with
Nikon retail business,

12
00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:45.733
like the example from the previous video.

13
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:50.318
I might ask, what are the top few things,
top three things you wish were working

14
00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.551
better, and
maybe they'll share business problems.

15
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:58.507
Like they like to increase conversions
number of people that go to the website

16
00:00:58.507 --> 00:01:01.270
and convert to a sale or reduce inventory.

17
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.531
So you don't need as much stuff
sitting around in the warehouse, or

18
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:09.067
increased margin,
increase the profit per item sold.

19
00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:13.690
At this point in the process,
I'm not trying to identify an AI problem.

20
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.480
In fact, I often tell my partners I don't
want to hear about your AI problems.

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.276
I want to hear about your
business problems and

22
00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:25.228
then it's my job to work with you
to see if there is an Ai solution.

23
00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:27.560
And sometimes there isn't and
that's fine too.

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.960
Feel free to use the exact same words as
well when brainstorming projects with your

25
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.927
non AI partners.

26
00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:37.396
If you want having identified
a few business problems like

27
00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.959
the three examples on the right.

28
00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:46.343
Only then do I see or start to brainstorm
if there are possible AI solutions,

29
00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:50.860
not all problems can be solved by AI and
that's okay.

30
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.707
But hopefully we'll come
up with some ideas for

31
00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:59.440
using machine learning algorithms,
to address some of the business problems.

32
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.360
I find it is hopeful for

33
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.921
this process to separate out
the identification of the problem,

34
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:11.691
from the identification of
the solution as engineers.

35
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:18.156
We are pretty good at coming up with
solutions, but having a clear articulation

36
00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:24.540
of what is the problem first often
helps us come up with better solutions.

37
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.005
This type of separation between
problem and solution is

38
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:33.140
something you might hear about in
the writings on design thinking as well.

39
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.631
After brainstorming a variety
of different solutions,

40
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:44.010
I would then assess the feasibility and
the value of these different solutions.

41
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.440
Sometimes you hear me use the word
diligence, to refer to this phrase.

42
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.425
Diligence is a term that actually
comes from the legal field, but

43
00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:56.760
it basically means
double-checking if an AI solution

44
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.680
really is technically feasible and
valuable.

45
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.975
Double-checking something that you're
hoping, it's true really is true,

46
00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:08.937
after validating technical feasibility and
value or ROI.

47
00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:13.691
Return on investment if you can project
if it still looks promising right,

48
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:15.587
if it still looks promising.

49
00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:22.840
We then flesh out the milestones for the
project and finally budget for resources.

50
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.597
Let's take a deeper look at this
process of identifying problems,

51
00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:33.951
and solutions and
we'll use these three examples from Nikon.

52
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.597
So the first one increased conversion,
if the business wants

53
00:03:40.597 --> 00:03:47.040
to increase conversions, you may
have different ideas are doing that.

54
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.945
For example, you may want to improve
the quality of the website search results.

55
00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:57.175
So people find more relevant
products when they search.

56
00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:01.995
Or you might decide to try to offer
a better product recommendations based on

57
00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:04.340
their purchase history.

58
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.978
It is quite common that one problem may
lead to multiple ideas for solutions.

59
00:04:11.978 --> 00:04:15.652
And you may be able to bring
some other ideas as well,

60
00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:20.350
such as maybe a redesign of how
products are displayed on the page.

61
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.007
Or you may find interesting ways to
surface the most relevant product reviews,

62
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:29.130
to help users understand the product and
does hopefully purchase it.

63
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.350
So there can be many ways
to increase conversions.

64
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.740
Take the next problem from the previous
slide of reducing inventory.

65
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.283
Maybe, you can imagine
a demand prediction project to

66
00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:46.034
better estimate how many
people buy something from you.

67
00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:48.898
So you don't purchase too many or
too few, and

68
00:04:48.898 --> 00:04:52.640
have more accurate inventory
in your warehouses.

69
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.369
Or you may decide to come up with
a marketing campaign to drive sales for

70
00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:01.540
specifically the products
that you bought too many of.

71
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.801
So as to steer more purchases of
stuff sitting in your warehouse.

72
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:12.091
And that could also reduce inventory,
and there could be many other ideas for

73
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:16.372
solutions or for
the problem of increasing margin.

74
00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:22.251
You may come up with some ways to use
machine learning to optimize what to sell.

75
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:25.540
What is worth selling and
what is not worth selling.

76
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.613
And Nikon retail, sometimes this is called
merchandising, just deciding what to sell.

77
00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:34.427
Or you can recommend bundles
where if someone buys a camera.

78
00:05:34.427 --> 00:05:38.091
Maybe you can recommend to them
a protective camera case and

79
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:40.661
these bundles can also increase margin.

80
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.091
The problem identification is
a step of thinking through

81
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.109
whether the things you want to achieve.

82
00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:53.624
And solution identification is
a process of thinking through

83
00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:56.840
how to achieve those objectives.

84
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.185
One thing I still see too many
teams do today is jump into

85
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:04.203
the first project that they're
excited about in my experience.

86
00:06:04.203 --> 00:06:07.712
If you have deep domain knowledge
about an application or

87
00:06:07.712 --> 00:06:12.256
industry may be the first thing your
gut gets excited about could be okay.

88
00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:16.342
But even then I find it worthwhile
to first engage in divergent

89
00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:20.045
thinking where you brainstorm
a lot of possibilities.

90
00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:24.333
To be followed by conversion thinking
where you then narrow it down to one or

91
00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:28.140
a small handful of the most
promising projects to focus on.

92
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.910
One thing I hope you might avoid is
working really hard on the project and

93
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.040
creating a certain amount of monetary or
social value.

94
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.177
If for the same amount of work, there's
a different project that could have

95
00:06:42.177 --> 00:06:47.740
created 10 times more, monitoring or
social or other positive types of value.

96
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.861
And I think this type of scoping
process will help you to do that.
