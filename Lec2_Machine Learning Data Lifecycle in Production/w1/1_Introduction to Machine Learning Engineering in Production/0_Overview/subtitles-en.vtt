00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Hey, and welcome to collecting,

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.555
labeling, and validating data.

3
00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:10.575
This course is all about
data and not just data,

4
00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:14.220
but data in a production
machine learning setting,

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.080
you'll discover that there are

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.640
quite a few differences between

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.920
production data and data

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.765
that you might have
been using in,

9
00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.315
an academic or
research environment

10
00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.895
and that's what this
course is all about.

11
00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:28.845
I'm really excited
to get started,

12
00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:30.380
so let's get going.

13
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.060
We've got some really
important stuff

14
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.455
to talk about this week.

15
00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:35.900
This week is all about data,

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.100
collecting our data, labeling
it, and validating it.

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.815
Let's get started
before we jump in.

18
00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:45.500
I know there maybe some of
you who are coming from

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.680
a more academic or
research setting

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.190
who might be thinking data?

21
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.820
I already know all about

22
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.280
data what am I going
to learn here?

23
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.080
Well, in production environments,

24
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.820
you discover some
interesting things

25
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.955
about the importance of data.

26
00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:04.730
Hear two quotes from
ML practitioners

27
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.990
had businesses where Data
and ML is mission-critical.

28
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.095
Talking about how they view
the importance of data.

29
00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.490
First, from Uber, Data is

30
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.990
the hardest part of ML and

31
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.705
the most important
piece to get right.

32
00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.920
Broken data is the most
common cause of problems in

33
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.920
production ML Systems
and next from Gojek,

34
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.340
no other activity in the
machine learning lifecycle has

35
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.280
a higher return on
investment than

36
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.480
improving the data a
model has access to.

37
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.570
The truth is that if
you go to just about

38
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.460
any production ML team

39
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.620
and ask them about the
importance of data.

40
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.070
You'll get similar answers.

41
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.040
So that's why we're talking about

42
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.795
data because it's
incredibly important to

43
00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:58.100
success and the issues for

44
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.830
data in production
environments are

45
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.595
very different from the academic
or research environments

46
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.685
that you might be familiar with.

47
00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.840
Okay, now that we've got

48
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.825
that out of the
way, let's dive in.

49
00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.675
So this is our Introduction to

50
00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.059
Machine Learning for production

51
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.710
and we're going to
start with an overview.

52
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.375
Let's get started by
establishing what

53
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.000
Machine Learning
and Production is?

54
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.720
And how you can view
Production ML really as

55
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.465
a combination of ML development

56
00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.705
and modern software
development practices?

57
00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.300
We'll also discuss
some of the challenges

58
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.910
that are unique to Production ML.

59
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.860
In an academic or
research setting,

60
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.575
modeling is really fairly simple.

61
00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:51.545
Well, maybe not simple,

62
00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:53.845
but perhaps less complicated.

63
00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:57.725
Anyway, typically you
have some dataset,

64
00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:00.245
often standard dataset that

65
00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.930
supplied to you and
already cleaned and

66
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.390
labeled and you're
going to use that to

67
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.960
train your model and
evaluate the results.

68
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.785
The end result is a model
that makes good predictions.

69
00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:14.570
So you'll probably go through

70
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.525
a few iterations to fully
optimize the model.

71
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:19.880
Once you're satisfied
with the results,

72
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.680
then typically you're done.

73
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.790
Production ML requires a
lot more than just a model.

74
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.720
We found that the model is
typically about 5 percent of

75
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.280
the code required to put

76
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.940
an ML application
into production.

77
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.370
Take a look at all
the other boxes

78
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.870
that are in this
diagram and you'll

79
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.410
get some idea about what we're
going to be talking about.

80
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.630
Fundamentally, we're not just

81
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.760
talking about machine
learning and modeling.

82
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.255
We're talking about
Production ML applications

83
00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:52.370
and what it takes to create them,

84
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.860
deploy them, maintain them,

85
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.870
and improve them so that

86
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.540
you can make them
available to your users

87
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.340
and your business or

88
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.690
your organization if you're

89
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.310
doing something
like a non-profit.

90
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.420
Let's compare some of

91
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.419
the differences between ML
modeling in a researcher,

92
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.335
academic setting and
real production ML.

93
00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:19.835
To start with, in an academic
or research environment,

94
00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:23.195
you're typically using
a static dataset

95
00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:27.710
for Production ML
real-world data is used,

96
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.085
which is dynamic and
usually shifting.

97
00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:33.170
The design priority for

98
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.870
academic or research
ML is usually

99
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.130
the highest accuracy over
the entire training set but

100
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.350
the design priority for

101
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.010
Production ML is
fast inference and

102
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.525
good interpretability and of
course, accuracy and cost.

103
00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:56.910
Model training for
research ML is based on

104
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.450
a single optimal result and

105
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.510
the tuning and training
necessary to achieve it.

106
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.560
Production ML requires
continuous monitoring,

107
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.500
assessment, and retraining.

108
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.680
Interpretability and fairness is

109
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.320
very important for
any ML modeling,

110
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.155
but it's absolutely
crucial for Production ML.

111
00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:24.980
Finally, while, the main
challenge of academic and

112
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.300
research ML is finding intuiting,
a high-accuracy model.

113
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.660
For production ML the
challenge is that

114
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.500
plus everything else,
the entire system.

115
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.050
It would be fair to
say that you can look

116
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.230
at Production Machine Learning
as both machine learning

117
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.410
itself and the
knowledge and skillset

118
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.635
required and modern
software development.

119
00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:55.120
It really requires expertise in

120
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.039
both areas to be successful,

121
00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.429
because you're not just
producing a single result,

122
00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:03.580
you're developing a
product or service that

123
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.255
is often a mission critical
part of your offering.

124
00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:10.724
ML development itself
focuses on specific issues

125
00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:14.905
related with the data and
the quality of predictions.

126
00:06:14.905 --> 00:06:16.630
For example, assuming that

127
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.025
you're doing supervised learning,

128
00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:21.460
then you need to make sure
that your labels are accurate,

129
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.170
and you also need
to make sure that

130
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.875
your training dataset
has examples which cover

131
00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:27.940
the same feature space as

132
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.774
the request that your
model will receive.

133
00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:34.090
You also want to reduce
the dimensionality of

134
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.500
your feature vector to optimize
your system performance,

135
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.940
while retaining or enhancing

136
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.200
the predictive
information on your data.

137
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.225
Throughout all of this,

138
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:47.039
you need to consider and measure

139
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.600
the fairness of your
data and model,

140
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.030
especially for rare conditions,

141
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.555
for example, in domains
such as health care,

142
00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:59.020
where rare but
important conditions

143
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.365
may be absolutely
critical to success.

144
00:07:02.365 --> 00:07:04.930
But on top of all of that,

145
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.270
you're putting a piece
of software into

146
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.869
production that requires
a system design,

147
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.555
that includes all of the
things that are required for

148
00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:16.380
any production
software deployment.

149
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.580
Of course, this
deployment has to be

150
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.075
focused on ML and
your application.

151
00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.820
Is your system scalable?

152
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.150
Can you scale it
both up and down?

153
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.040
Can you extend it

154
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.580
cleanly to add new
stuff when you need to?

155
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.465
Does it have a clear,
well-defined configuration?

156
00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:39.135
Is it consistent?

157
00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:42.025
Can you reliably
reproduce results?

158
00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:44.935
Is it hardened against attacks?

159
00:07:44.935 --> 00:07:47.295
Is the design modular?

160
00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:50.200
Following modern software
development principles.

161
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.515
Can you test individual units?

162
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.380
Can you do end-to-end testing?

163
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.915
Can you continuously monitor
the health and performance

164
00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:05.025
of your system and be alerted
when there are problems?

165
00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:08.820
Have you adopted
industry best practices?

166
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.735
Using a model in real-world
applications requires

167
00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:14.800
much more than just
an understanding

168
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.860
of machine learning algorithms.

169
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.715
The first step is scoping,

170
00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.970
which focuses on defining
the project needs and

171
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.615
goals and the resources
required to achieve them.

172
00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:28.290
Next, you start
working on your data,

173
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.735
which defining the
features that you're

174
00:08:31.735 --> 00:08:35.935
going to use well as organizing
and labeling your data.

175
00:08:35.935 --> 00:08:38.500
That may sometimes
include measuring

176
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.019
human level performance to set
a baseline for comparison.

177
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.360
Then you design
and train a model.

178
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.620
In this phase, error
analysis will help you

179
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.730
refine your model to suit
your project's needs.

180
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.780
After training your model,

181
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.585
you deploy it so that it can be

182
00:08:57.585 --> 00:09:00.165
used to serve
prediction requests.

183
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.900
You might deploy your model on

184
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.164
mobile devices, on a Cloud,

185
00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:06.405
or in IoT devices,

186
00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:08.670
or even in a web browser.

187
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.940
Over time, real-world data
continuously changes,

188
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.150
which can result in

189
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.845
a degradation of your
model performance.

190
00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:18.800
You need to continuously

191
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.280
monitor the performance
of your model,

192
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.745
and if you measure a
drop in performance,

193
00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:26.935
you need to go back to model
retraining and tuning,

194
00:09:26.935 --> 00:09:28.820
or revise your data.

195
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.910
During deployment,
new data may affect

196
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.750
your project design
either positively or

197
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.640
negatively and risk coping
might be necessary.

198
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.500
Ultimately, all these steps

199
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.595
create your production ML system,

200
00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:47.990
which needs to run
automatically such that

201
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.375
you're continuously monitoring
your model performance,

202
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:55.495
ingesting new data, and
retraining as needed,

203
00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:57.615
and then redeploying to

204
00:09:57.615 --> 00:10:00.585
maintain or improve
your performance.

205
00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:03.470
The challenges when
doing production ML are

206
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.285
very different than
academic or research ML,

207
00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:10.845
or in some sense they're the
same but include a lot more.

208
00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:13.575
You're going to be building
an integrated system

209
00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:16.420
specifically focused
on ML use cases.

210
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.140
You need to think about operating

211
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.334
it continuously in production,

212
00:10:20.334 --> 00:10:22.040
and for online use cases,

213
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.140
that means it has to
stay available 24/7.

214
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.885
You've got to think about
and put systems in place,

215
00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:31.280
to handle a changing world and

216
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.640
changing data, and of course,

217
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.440
like any production system,

218
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.875
you need to try to
do all of this at

219
00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:43.230
the minimum cost while producing
the maximum performance.

220
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.955
It might seem daunting,

221
00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:48.130
but the good news
is that there are

222
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.825
well-established tools and
methodologies for doing this,

223
00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:55.555
and we'll be covering many
of those in this course.

224
00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:58.565
The challenges when
doing production ML are

225
00:10:58.565 --> 00:11:02.045
very different than
academic or research ML,

226
00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:06.995
or in some sense they're the
same but include a lot more.

227
00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:09.800
You're going to be building
an integrated system

228
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.495
specifically focused
on ML use cases.

229
00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:15.305
You need to think about operating

230
00:11:15.305 --> 00:11:17.590
it continuously in production,

231
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.260
and for online use cases,

232
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.960
that means it has to
stay available 24/7.

233
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.799
You've got to think about
and put systems in place,

234
00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:29.270
to handle a changing world and

235
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.170
changing data, and of course,

236
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.635
like any production system,

237
00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:37.120
you need to try to
do all of this at

238
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.070
the minimum cost while producing
the maximum performance.

239
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.500
It might seem daunting,

240
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.700
but the good news
is that there are

241
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.490
well-established tools
and methodologies for

242
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.590
doing all of this and you'll

243
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.020
learn a lot about
them in this course.
