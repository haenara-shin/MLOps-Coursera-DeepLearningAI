00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.620
Hi, welcome to this
specialization on

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.960
Machine Learning Engine
for production, MLOps.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.650
Say you've trained an accurate
machine learning model

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.955
in the Jupiter Notebook,

5
00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:16.630
you celebrate that and you
might now be wondering,

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.380
now what do I do.

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.345
After reaching the milestone
of developing a good model,

8
00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.775
actually putting your
model into production.

9
00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:26.260
They have a working system

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.895
that is making
useful predictions.

11
00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.025
That's still requires much more.

12
00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:33.550
This specialization will teach
you the skills you need to

13
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.299
build and deploy production
machine learning systems.

14
00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.560
You learned about
the full machine

15
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.955
learning process lifecycle

16
00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:41.610
from scoping out your project,

17
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.345
to data, to modeling
through deployment.

18
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.730
You're better execute the machine

19
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.780
learning project all the

20
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.045
way from start to finish.

21
00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.400
One common misconception is that

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.210
the only difference between
developing model that you fit

23
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.460
the notebook on your local
machine and deploy that model

24
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.895
into production is literally
just the deployment piece,

25
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.890
maybe just a bunch of
software engineering.

26
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.360
But that's not true, it's not

27
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.235
just a bunch of
software engineering.

28
00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.020
There are machine
learning challenges to

29
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.120
production as well that on edges

30
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.590
in the process of

31
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.070
developing a model
into Jupiter notebook.

32
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.820
This discipline of building

33
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.905
and maintaining
production systems,

34
00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.210
that is the processes in

35
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.830
tools for doing all
this is sometimes

36
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.345
called MLOps or machine
learning operations.

37
00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:26.795
You'll learn about that too.

38
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.235
I'm thrilled to be bringing you

39
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:29.960
this new specialization with

40
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.255
two fantastic instructors from

41
00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:33.905
the google TensorFlow team,

42
00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:36.595
Robert Crowe and
Lawrence Moroney.

43
00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.990
Robert Crowe is it
TensorFlow developer,

44
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.545
Engineer at Google, a

45
00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:42.965
Data Scientists and
TensorFlow advocate.

46
00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:44.915
Robert has a passion for helping

47
00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:47.525
developers quickly
learn what they need,

48
00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:50.125
hopefully what you
need to be productive.

49
00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:54.950
Lawrence Moroney, these AI
advocacy at google and is also

50
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.070
instructor of three other
TensorFlow specializations

51
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.500
with deep learning AI
and is also the book,

52
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.795
AI and machine learning,
if we call this.

53
00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:05.675
Glad to have both of you with
us for the specialization.

54
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.640
I'm delighted to
work with you again,

55
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.975
it's always a pleasure.

56
00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:10.880
As you said Andrew,
in addition to

57
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.010
building a first working model,

58
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.270
in a production system,

59
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.700
you need to handle a
whole range of issues,

60
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.725
including things like data drift,

61
00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:20.600
where the distribution
of the data you

62
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.090
trained on maybe
eventually become

63
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.790
very different from
the distribution

64
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.115
of the data that you're
running inference on.

65
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:31.565
A key topic that we'll
discuss is change.

66
00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.320
The world changes and

67
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.335
your model needs to be
aware of that change.

68
00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:39.560
In this specialization,
we'll also introduce you to

69
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.070
several related topics
outside of machine learning.

70
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.740
You can look at Production
Machine Learning

71
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.300
as both machine learning

72
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.805
itself and the
knowledge and skills

73
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:52.670
required in modern
software development.

74
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.050
If you're working on

75
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.224
a machine Learning
Team and industry,

76
00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:57.980
you really need expertise in

77
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.820
both machine learning and
software to be successful.

78
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.770
This is because
your team will not

79
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.900
just be producing
a single result.

80
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.820
You'll be developing a product or

81
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.830
service that will operate

82
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.145
continuously and maybe
a mission critical part

83
00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:14.435
of your company's work.

84
00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:16.280
That's right. I can say from

85
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.380
my own experience that oftentimes

86
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.510
the most challenging
aspects of building

87
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.700
machine learning
systems turn out to be

88
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.640
the things that you least
expected like deployment.

89
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.385
It's all very well being
able to build a model,

90
00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.830
but getting that into
people's hands and seeing how

91
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.725
they use it can be
very eye-opening.

92
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:35.540
You might think you
have the perfect model

93
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.710
for the perfect scenario,

94
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.910
but your users could have

95
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.515
different opinions and it's

96
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:41.330
always really good
to learn from them.

97
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.250
They might be, for example, okay,

98
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.480
with a round robin trip to

99
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.060
a server for a frequently
updated model.

100
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.740
Or they might insist
that their data

101
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.030
never leaves their device.

102
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.770
So you need to know
the best ways to keep

103
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.690
their on-device
models really fresh.

104
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.150
This specialization
contains four causes

105
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.890
that provide you with
the knowledge and

106
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.390
hands-on practice to get

107
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.330
a Production Machine Learning
system up and running.

108
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.535
In the first course
which I teach,

109
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.410
you see an overview of

110
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.820
the entire life cycle of

111
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.145
a production machine
learning project,

112
00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:12.575
from the scoping to getting data,

113
00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.930
to modeling, to deployment.

114
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.790
The second course is all about

115
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.490
data and how it
evolves over time.

116
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.020
With this course, you'll build

117
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.735
data pipelines by
gathering, cleaning,

118
00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:27.290
and validating data sets
using TensorFlow extended or

119
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.055
TFX and the TFX
family of Libraries.

120
00:04:31.055 --> 00:04:33.409
To understand your
data evolution,

121
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.290
you'll track changes
with ML metadata using

122
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.455
data provenance as a
conceptual framework.

123
00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:41.780
The third course is
focused on machine

124
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.299
learning modeling
pipelines in production.

125
00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:46.040
In this course,
you'll learn how to

126
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.750
manage modeling resources to

127
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.620
best serve inference
requests and minimize costs.

128
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.385
You'll also use analytics
to address model fairness,

129
00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:59.135
explain-ability issues,
and mitigate bottlenecks.

130
00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:01.330
Course 4 is all about deployment.

131
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.080
This means of course
that you want to get

132
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.375
ready to serve your
users requests.

133
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:06.965
Now this can be exciting

134
00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:09.350
and challenging all
at the same time.

135
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.890
In course 4, you'll deliver
deployment pipelines from

136
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.540
model serving that might

137
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.000
require many different
infrastructures.

138
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.045
You'll also apply best
practices to maintain

139
00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:22.000
a continuously
operating production

140
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.510
system that stays up to

141
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.370
date and importantly keeps

142
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.965
your users needs front of mind.

143
00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.605
As a learner in this
specialization,

144
00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:32.240
we're assuming that
you're comfortable with

145
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.820
Python programming
and Machine Learning

146
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.040
and that you have
some familiarity with

147
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.514
one of the deep-learning
frameworks in Python,

148
00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:43.085
like TensorFlow,
keras, or PyTorch.

149
00:05:43.085 --> 00:05:45.500
If you've completed the deep
learning specialization

150
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.690
offered by deep-learning data AI,

151
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.430
you should be in great shape

152
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.185
to start this specialization.

153
00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.120
Alternatively, of course,
if you've completed

154
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.410
the deep learning data AI

155
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.660
TensorFlow developer
certificate program,

156
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.040
you'll be really well-prepared

157
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.270
to start the specialization.

158
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.580
Great. Well with that,
let's get started.

159
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.005
That sounds great to me.

160
00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:05.460
Sounds good. Let's do it.
