00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.790
Welcome to the second
course in the machine

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.300
learning engine for production,
and MLOps specialization.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.920
In the first course, we looked at

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.439
the entire machine learning
project lifecycle.

5
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.549
As part of that, we also
went over data topics,

6
00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.890
like the consistency
of the labels,

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.470
practical approaches
to data augmentation.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.470
We also briefly touched on
some of the challenges of

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.634
building and maintaining
data pipelines.

10
00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.080
This second course will dive much

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.375
deeper into the issue of data,

12
00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.240
and how you can build
data pipelines.

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.205
I'm thrilled to reintroduce

14
00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.575
this course instructor,
Robert Growe,

15
00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.275
who's TensorFlow, developer
engineer at Google,

16
00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.175
and one of the world's
experts on MLOps.

17
00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.260
In this course, you'll explore

18
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.070
the data journey over a
production systems lifecycle.

19
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.260
You'll implement
feature engineering,

20
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.340
transformation, and selection,
with a TFX framework.

21
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.160
Look at responsible
data collection

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.220
for building a fair
ML production system,

23
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.170
and get an understanding of

24
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.480
deep model performance analysis.

25
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.130
You'll also look at ways
to improve your data,

26
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520
for better training
and generalization.

27
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.710
Along the way, you'll become

28
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.244
fairly familiar
with a TFX library,

29
00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.390
and learn to create a healthy and

30
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.690
fully operational data pipeline.

31
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.200
By encoding structured and
unstructured data types,

32
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.265
and addressing class imbalances,

33
00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:32.420
and by leveraging ML metadata
and enterprise schemas,

34
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.985
to address quickly evolving data.

35
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.310
Remember that production ML,

36
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.110
often becomes an
important part of

37
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.375
what a business does
for its customers.

38
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.500
Treating people fairly, and

39
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.860
serving different kinds
of customers well,

40
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.870
requires you to understand

41
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.180
your model performance
at a deeper level,

42
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.650
which is something
you'll learn about

43
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.135
more in this course.

44
00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.880
You'll also learn about
some specialized scenarios

45
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.680
like anomaly detection.

46
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.755
But the main focus of
this course is on data.

47
00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.790
Machine learning relies on data.

48
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.510
The quality of your data has

49
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.320
a huge impact on the success
of your product or service.

50
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.210
Because of that, the skills

51
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.020
and tools that
you'll learn about,

52
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.005
are becoming
increasingly prominent

53
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:16.620
in the current job market.

54
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.715
Thanks, Robert. I'm
excited about this.

55
00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:21.055
Anyone that masters
these techniques will

56
00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:23.340
be much more effective
at building robust,

57
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.745
deployable machine
learning systems.

58
00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.745
Thanks, Andrew. I'm
excited about this.

59
00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:31.700
Anyone that masters these
techniques will be much more

60
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.704
effective at building robust,
deployable ML systems.

61
00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:39.480
Let's dive into building
data pipelines.
