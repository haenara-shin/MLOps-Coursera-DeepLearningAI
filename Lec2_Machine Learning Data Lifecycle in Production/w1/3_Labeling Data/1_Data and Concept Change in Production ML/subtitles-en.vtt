00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.360
In our discussion
of labeling data,

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.960
let's take a look at data and

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.940
concept change in production ML.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.780
We're going to be
talking about detecting

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.240
problems with deployed models.

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.790
Really that focuses
on two things,

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.705
data change and concept
change or world change.

8
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.790
There's different kinds of this.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.980
We've talked about a
little bit of this,

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.450
we'll get into it some more.

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.400
There are different kinds
of changing ground truth.

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.970
There's easy problems,
there's harder problems,

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.970
and then you get really
hard problems and you need

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.800
different approaches to deal

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.280
with these. Let's look at them.

16
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.350
Detecting problems
with deployed models,

17
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.870
you can look at the
data and the scope of

18
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.110
the data and the world in a
couple of different ways,

19
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.760
but fundamentally, you need to

20
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.700
monitor your models
and you need to

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.100
validate the results
and the data of

22
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.310
your models to find problems.

23
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.080
You want to try to find problems

24
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.450
early especially with
system problems that

25
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.640
happen quickly like a bad sensor

26
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.090
or things like that,
that we've discussed.

27
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.615
But a fundamental issue
is changing ground truth.

28
00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.680
What that means is
that you need to label

29
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.775
new data over the life
of your application.

30
00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:27.560
It depends on really

31
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.720
the domain that you're
working in and the kinds of

32
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.840
problems that you're trying
to solve as far as what

33
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.835
approaches are really
feasible for doing that.

34
00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:39.465
There are easy problems.

35
00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:44.285
Things like, trying to recognize
images of cats and dogs.

36
00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.190
In this case, the ground truth

37
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.835
really changes pretty slowly.

38
00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:51.290
Model retraining in those cases

39
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.780
is usually driven by
model improvements,

40
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.540
you are better at
recognizing cats or dogs,

41
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.690
or whatever it is
that you're doing.

42
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.870
You could have changes
in software too.

43
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.960
You could be upgrading

44
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.149
things or using a
different library,

45
00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.585
that kind of thing, or systems.

46
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.560
Labeling in this case
is fairly simple,

47
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.900
you're going to work with maybe a

48
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.280
curated dataset that you're

49
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.730
getting from some
public domain source or

50
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.970
a source that your organization
has been using for

51
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.310
awhile or you could look
at crowd-based as well.

52
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.950
If it tends to be fairly
simple, things like feedback,

53
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.145
of course, if you have those
available, great, use them.

54
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:33.175
Use what you can.

55
00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:36.170
Then we get into a
little harder problems

56
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.320
where the ground truth
really changes faster.

57
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.970
Things like styles.

58
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.020
We looked at shoes,

59
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.705
but there's a lot of
things where styles.

60
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:48.935
The world changes on a
matter of maybe weeks,

61
00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.885
that kind of thing.

62
00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:53.600
Model retraining in
that case is usually

63
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.300
driven by declining
model performance,

64
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.185
which you need to measure if
you're going to be aware of.

65
00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:02.580
You can also have
model improvements,

66
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.970
you can also have better
data and of course,

67
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.230
the software and systems you're

68
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.210
running on can also change.

69
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.400
But as these things get harder,

70
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.830
you get more things and

71
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.415
declining model performance
is one of those.

72
00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.380
Labeling in this case,

73
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.680
if you can do direct
feedback either from

74
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.115
your systems or from your
users, that's great.

75
00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:27.950
Crowd-based human labeling is

76
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.850
another feasible
way of doing this,

77
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.525
since you do have probably
weeks to respond.

78
00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:39.385
You can take a pass through
human raters to do that.

79
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.975
Really hard problems though,

80
00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.655
it becomes well, really hard.

81
00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:48.440
In this case, ground
truth changes very fast,

82
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.105
like on order of days or
hours or even minutes.

83
00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:57.380
Things like markets really
fall into this category,

84
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.600
they change very quickly.

85
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.580
In this case, declining
model performance

86
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.690
is definitely going to be

87
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.705
a driver for when you need
to retrain your model.

88
00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:07.310
You can also have things like

89
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.740
model improvements and changes
in software and so forth,

90
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.565
but those tend to be things
that you'll be working on

91
00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:18.020
offline while you're keeping
your application running.

92
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.830
It's really model performance
where you really need

93
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.935
well-defined processes to
deal with those changes.

94
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:28.595
Labeling in this case
becomes very challenging.

95
00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:33.785
Direct feedback is great if
you can do it in your domain.

96
00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.810
If not, you need to
look at things like

97
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.135
week supervision that
we'll talk about.

98
00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:42.680
But it's really challenging
in these kinds of domains.

99
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.530
They tend to be
high-value domains.

100
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.825
Things like predicting
markets where there's

101
00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:52.225
significant incentive to
doing these predictions.

102
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.280
The key points of what
we're talking about here,

103
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.210
model performance
decays over time.

104
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.950
It may decay slowly over time,

105
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.530
in things like cats and dogs,

106
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.405
that doesn't change very quickly,

107
00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:10.160
or it may change very
fast, things like markets.

108
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.220
Model retraining will help you

109
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.250
improve or maintain
your performance.

110
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.765
Certainly as your model
performance decays,

111
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:22.625
it'll help you do that.

112
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.970
Data labeling, assuming you're
doing supervised learning,

113
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.695
which is pretty common,

114
00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:30.280
data labeling is a
key part of that.

115
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.370
You really need to think

116
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.525
about how you're
going to approach

117
00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:34.954
that in your particular problem,

118
00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:37.805
in your particular
domain and with

119
00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:42.030
the systems that you
have available to you.
