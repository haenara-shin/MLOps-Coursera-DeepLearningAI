00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.140
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.317
The only constant in
the universe is change.

3
00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:13.340
That quote is actually attributed to
Heraclitus of a thesis in 500 BC.

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.584
And I think it's fairly safe to
say that it's still true today and

5
00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.680
it affects production amount.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.519
So for example if you had trained a model
a few years ago to recognize what

7
00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.180
a book looks like,
it might have looked like this.

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.540
If you train a model today, you'd also
want to include books that look like this.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.951
Let's find out more now.

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.240
To illustrate some of the issues with
labeled data in performance settings,

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.561
let's take a look at a case study.

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.875
So imagine that you're
an online retailer and

13
00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:54.587
you're selling shoes and
you have a model that predicts click

14
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.861
through rates which helps you to
decide how much inventory to order.

15
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.136
And suddenly the AUC and
prediction accuracy have dropped not

16
00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:11.240
on everything but
on a particular part of your inventory.

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.840
Men's dress shoes.

18
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.440
Okay.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.021
Why?
You trained your model?

20
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.431
You did fairly well in your metrics and
so forth.

21
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:22.361
Why is it different?

22
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:23.150
What changed?

23
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.263
Why does your model not predict
men's dress shoes well now?

24
00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:32.500
And perhaps more importantly, how do
you even know that you have a problem?

25
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.851
Your models still running?

26
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.549
It's still giving predictions.

27
00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.840
You're still ordering inventory.

28
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.409
How do you know that the orders
that you're making and

29
00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.040
the predictions that your model is giving
you are not as good as they used to be?

30
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.949
Well, unfortunately,
if you don't put good practices into place

31
00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:56.858
in the production setting,
you're probably going to find out either

32
00:01:56.858 --> 00:02:01.440
when you order way too many shoes or
not enough shoes.

33
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.820
And that's not a situation that
you want to be in in a business.

34
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.129
This is going to cost you money.

35
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.851
So you need to think about how you're
going to detect problems like that early.

36
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:20.135
And what the possible causes are so
that you can look for

37
00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:23.140
those and monitor your system.

38
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.521
And then try to have methods systems
in place to deal with those problems

39
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:33.551
when they happen because they
probably will happen at some point.

40
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.530
But what kinds of problems?

41
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.872
Well, there's different kinds and

42
00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:42.940
they tend to fall into
two different categories.

43
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.040
There are slow problems.

44
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.509
So for example, your data will drift
over time as the world changes and

45
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.561
seasons pass and you have holidays and

46
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:02.040
competitors enter or change what have you.

47
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.101
And then you have fast problems that
are really part of your system.

48
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:11.056
So you have a sensor that goes bad or
you have a software update

49
00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:15.840
that gets applied and
suddenly things are wonky.

50
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.523
So you need to really be monitoring
your system well and looking for

51
00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:25.471
both of those problems and
thinking about remediation in both cases.

52
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:30.401
For gradual problems, they tend to
fall into two groups really, but

53
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:36.100
they're interrelated too so it's not
like there's a hard line between them.

54
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.052
Trend and seasonality for example,
especially in time series you will

55
00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:46.168
have trends and you will have seasonality
in most cases and you could argue

56
00:03:46.168 --> 00:03:51.540
about whether that's really a change
in data or a change in the world.

57
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.941
Same thing with the distribution
of the features.

58
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.284
Again, it's something that
you see in your data.

59
00:03:57.284 --> 00:04:03.112
And the relative importance of features
can change too as the relative importance

60
00:04:03.112 --> 00:04:08.451
changes, if you haven't retrained
your model accuracy starts to decay.

61
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.548
The world also changes constantly.

62
00:04:12.548 --> 00:04:17.154
And in production settings that
has to become part of the systems

63
00:04:17.154 --> 00:04:21.740
that you design and
the processes that you have in place.

64
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.238
Things like, well,
if we're working in retail and

65
00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:29.470
we're just looking at an example
with shoes, styles change.

66
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.056
So, maybe last year black shoes
were really fashionable for

67
00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:41.640
men's dress shoes and
now it's brown shoes or what have you.

68
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.561
The scope and the processes change.

69
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:49.062
So your understanding
of those processes and

70
00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:53.800
how they happen in the world
will affect how your

71
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.310
model views the results
of those processes.

72
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.300
Competitors change and
your business also changes.

73
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.737
So you may take on new products,

74
00:05:05.737 --> 00:05:10.614
you may end of life other products
you may have new competitors,

75
00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:16.212
you may expand into other geography
ease or you may move out of geography,

76
00:05:16.212 --> 00:05:21.087
ease prices from suppliers change,
prices on the open market,

77
00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:26.361
change all of that affects how your
model needs to adapt to the world.

78
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:31.311
And this tends to be very domain specific,
but in general,

79
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:38.740
in nearly all domains, changes in
the world affect your model performance.

80
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.997
So for sudden problems, there's things
that you're probably familiar with.

81
00:05:43.997 --> 00:05:49.308
So data collection problems,
things like a bad sensor or bad camera,

82
00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:54.079
the log data suddenly changes and
you have a different format or

83
00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:59.841
the logs themselves are may be rotated
differently, you can have a sensor or

84
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.913
a camera that doesn't really change,
but it moves.

85
00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:09.950
Maybe it gets bumped or maybe someone
decided it should be in a different spot.

86
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.939
I personally have seen that
happen where we had cameras that

87
00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.907
someone decided that they should be
moved and didn't tell us about that.

88
00:06:18.907 --> 00:06:19.446
[LAUGH].

89
00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:20.600
Systems problems.

90
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.927
So you're going to have software updates
all the time and if they change something

91
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:30.560
significant that you weren't aware of,
that can be a real problem.

92
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.164
Network connectivity.

93
00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:35.610
No, no, the network never goes down,
does it?

94
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.340
Well, maybe sometimes it does.

95
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.187
Systems too.

96
00:06:39.187 --> 00:06:41.022
Whole systems can go down.

97
00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:42.405
So be aware of that.

98
00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:42.958
[LAUGH].

99
00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:48.062
And bad credentials, you sign
credentials and often they time out or

100
00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:52.990
something changes about them,
all those things can cause a sudden

101
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.451
problem that all of a sudden it's a fire
drill and you need to deal with it.

102
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.599
So part of this is really trying
to understand your model and

103
00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.540
how it's sensitive to different
changes in the world.

104
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:14.050
A big issue here is that miss predictions
don't have uniform cost to your business.

105
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.740
Some miss predictions will have very
little effect on your business.

106
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.960
Other miss predictions
could have huge effects.

107
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.926
So understanding that and
really as you're monitoring things,

108
00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:34.440
looking for things that have
larger impacts is important.

109
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.640
The data you have as you collect data is
rarely the data that you wish you had.

110
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.625
So I've personally seen cases where
we were using sensor data from

111
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:49.580
wifi devices and it was not great data.

112
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.901
It was really noisy and
but it was all we had.

113
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:55.740
It was all we could have.

114
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.540
So we had to work with what we had.

115
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.318
The model objective is
almost always a proxy for

116
00:08:02.318 --> 00:08:05.351
what you're really trying to get to.

117
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:10.027
In many cases, sometimes you can design
a model and you have the data to

118
00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:15.140
design a model for exactly the thing
that you're trying to attack.

119
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.883
But often, as in the case of
the shoes that we just looked at,

120
00:08:19.883 --> 00:08:23.976
we were predicting click
through rates as a proxy for

121
00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:27.840
deciding how much inventory to order.

122
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.440
Some percentage of your customers
will have a bad experience.

123
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.827
You want that percentage to be as small
as possible and as much as possible,

124
00:08:37.827 --> 00:08:42.361
you want to understand which
customers those are going to be, so

125
00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:45.950
that you can try to design
ways to mitigate that and

126
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.540
improve the situation for
all of your customers.

127
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.440
But the bottom line here that you will
deal with constantly is that the real

128
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.840
world does not stand still.

129
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.861
The one constant in the world is change.
