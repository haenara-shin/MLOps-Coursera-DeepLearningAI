00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Now, let's discuss

2
00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:06.390
another popular enterprise
storage solution, data lakes.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.350
A data lake is a
system or repository

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.235
of data stored in its
natural and raw format,

5
00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:18.120
which is usually in the
form of blobs or files.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.015
A data lake, like
a data warehouse,

7
00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.280
aggregates data from various
sources of enterprise data.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.930
A data lake can include
structured data like

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.355
racial databases or semi-structured
data like CSV files,

10
00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.780
or unstructured data like

11
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.620
a collection of images or
documents, and so forth.

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.115
Since data lake store
data in its raw format,

13
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.425
they don't do any processing,

14
00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.760
and they usually don't
follow a schema.

15
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.640
How does a data lake differ
from a data warehouse?

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.590
Let's compare the two.

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830
The primary difference
between them

18
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.065
is that in a data warehouse,

19
00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:01.400
data is stored in

20
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.430
a consistent format
which follows a schema,

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.275
whereas in data lakes,

22
00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.200
the data is usually
in its raw format.

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.260
In data lakes, the
reason for storing

24
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.635
the data is often not
determined ahead of time.

25
00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:19.835
This is usually not the
case for a data warehouse,

26
00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:23.225
where it's usually stored
for a particular purpose.

27
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.910
Data warehouses are often used

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.610
by business
professionals as well,

29
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.640
whereas data lakes are typically

30
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.320
used only by data professionals
such as data scientists.

31
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.480
Since the data in

32
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.109
data warehouses is stored
in a consistent format,

33
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.250
changes to the data can
be complex and costly.

34
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.219
Data lakes however
are more flexible,

35
00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.580
and make it easier to
make changes to the data.

36
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.094
Let's review our discussion
of enterprise data storage.

37
00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:59.780
First, you learned
about feature stores,

38
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.040
which are repositories for
highly curated feature data,

39
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.905
specifically for use
in machine learning.

40
00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.335
You learned about
subject-oriented

41
00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:12.395
read-optimized data repositories,

42
00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:14.875
known as data warehouses.

43
00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.575
Finally, you explored data lakes,

44
00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:22.205
which are repositories for
raw and unprocessed data.

45
00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:24.920
We've come to the end
of another week and

46
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.305
we talked about a lot of
great stuff this week.

47
00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:31.550
ML metadata, working with
storage for features stores,

48
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.135
schemas, data lakes,
and data warehouses.

49
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.365
I hope you had fun.

50
00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.420
I sure did. We'll
see you next time.
