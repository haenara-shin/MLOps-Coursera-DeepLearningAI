00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
Now we're going to discuss
data warehouses. Fun fact.

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.645
I once worked in a warehouse,

3
00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:08.175
but it wasn't a data warehouse.

4
00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.530
It was an industrial
tool warehouse.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.565
Anyway, let's get
started. Data warehouses.

6
00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:16.245
Now let's discuss

7
00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:19.980
another popular enterprise
data storage solution.

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.785
Data warehouses.

9
00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:24.080
Data warehouses were
originally developed for

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.335
big data and business
intelligence applications,

11
00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:30.830
but they're also valuable
tools for production ML.

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.940
A data warehouse is

13
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.520
a technology that
aggregates data from

14
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.725
one or more sources

15
00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:40.150
so that it can be
processed and analyzed.

16
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.260
A data warehouse is usually meant

17
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.270
for long running batch jobs

18
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.385
and their storage is optimized
for read operations.

19
00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:52.820
Data entering into the warehouse
may not be in real time.

20
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.830
When you're storing data
in a data warehouse,

21
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.195
your data needs to follow
a consistent schema.

22
00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:01.790
Let's look at some key
features of data warehouses.

23
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.300
A data warehouse is
subject oriented and

24
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.980
the information
that's stored in it

25
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.184
revolves around a topic.

26
00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:11.310
For example, data stored

27
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.100
in a data warehouse
may be focused

28
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.050
on the organization's
customers or vendors, or etc.

29
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.250
The data in data warehouse may be

30
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.025
collected from multiple
types of sources,

31
00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.245
such as relational databases
or files and so forth.

32
00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:29.240
The data collected in a
data warehouse is usually

33
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.480
timestamped to
maintain the context

34
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.980
of when it was generated.

35
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.530
Data warehouses are nonvolatile,

36
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.290
which means the
previous versions of

37
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.480
data are not erased
when new data is added.

38
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.770
That means that you
can access the data

39
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.200
stored in a data warehouse as

40
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.210
a function of time and

41
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.170
understand how that
data has evolved.

42
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.645
Let's look at some advantages
of data warehouses.

43
00:01:56.645 --> 00:02:00.110
First, data warehouses
offer enhanced ability to

44
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.660
analyze your data by
time stamping your data.

45
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.445
A data warehouse can
help maintain contexts.

46
00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:10.400
When you store your data
in a data warehouse,

47
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.610
it follows a consistent
schema and that helps

48
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.360
improve the data quality
and consistency.

49
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.050
Studies have shown that the
return on investment for

50
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.820
data warehouses tend to be

51
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.490
fairly high for many use cases.

52
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.220
Lastly, the read and query

53
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.730
efficiency from data
warehouses is typically high,

54
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.715
giving you fast
access to your data.

55
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:38.085
You're probably familiar
with databases.

56
00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:39.905
A natural question is,

57
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.390
what's the difference
between a data

58
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.660
warehouse and a database?

59
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.175
Here are some comparisons.

60
00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:49.520
Data warehouses are meant
for analyzing data,

61
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.770
whereas databases are often

62
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.280
used for transaction purposes.

63
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.330
Inside a data warehouse,

64
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.490
there may be a delay
between storing

65
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.350
the data and the data getting
reflected in the system.

66
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.860
But in a database,

67
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.295
data is usually available
immediately after it's stored.

68
00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:10.639
Data warehouses store data
as a function of time,

69
00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.405
and therefore, historical
data is also available.

70
00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.810
Data warehouses are
typically capable of storing

71
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.290
a larger amount of data
compared to databases.

72
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.350
Queries in data
warehouses are complex in

73
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.920
nature and tend to
run for a long time.

74
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.590
Whereas queries in database are

75
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.025
simple and tend to
run in real time.

76
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.150
Normalization is not necessary
for data warehouses,

77
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.820
but it should be
used with databases.
